<p> This is for two of my video projects! I hope you'll enjoy them! They are very experimental and I am open to new ideas and suggestions. My first video is about how memories of travel can be spontaneous and it was without sound so it appeared to be like an old time reel replaying past memories. The second video was about the feelings of Fall and how the endlessness of the season can replay and create nostalgia.</p>
