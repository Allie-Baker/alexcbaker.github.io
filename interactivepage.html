  <h1> Welcome To My Page of Interactivity! It's a work in PROGRESS!</h1>
<h2> Artist's Statement</h2>
	<p>My name is Alexandra Baker and I am a digital media artist. I care about connecting with people and being able to
	share relatable topics such as media art. In this type of art I am looking more in to taking footage and turning them in to
GIF in which I can use for web based topics, like having an image like the one on here (a person pointing and gesturing) pointing to links
to be clicked to a linked page. How I will do this is another question I will be focusing on because there are many way to do it.
However, the endgame will be to produce a web page with interactivity in which clikable links will open other pages to different subjects.</p>
